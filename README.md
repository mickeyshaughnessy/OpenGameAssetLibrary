# Simple Asset Library

A streamlined digital asset management system with checkout functionality, built with Flask and designed for simplicity and ease of use.

## Overview

This system provides a basic but robust digital asset library where users can:
- Add digital assets (artwork, 3D models, audio, etc.) with unique S3 storage URLs
- Browse and search the asset collection with filtering
- Check out assets permanently (no returns)
- View library statistics and asset details

**Design Philosophy:** Keep it simple. No complex versioning, no batch operations, no returns - just core library functionality that works.

## Features

- üéØ **Simple Asset Management** - Add, browse, search, and checkout digital assets
- üîç **Flexible Search** - Text search with type, author, and rarity filters
- üìä **Statistics Dashboard** - Library overview with breakdowns by type, rarity, and author
- üîó **Unique S3 URLs** - Each asset gets its own S3 storage path for downloads
- üì± **REST API** - Clean JSON API for easy integration
- ‚úÖ **No Dependencies** - No database required, uses simple JSON file storage

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simple-asset-library
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python api_server.py
   ```

3. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   python simple_test.py
   ```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and automatically create sample data.
